This project was aimed to develop an application named “E-Lock” for computer remote control through fingerprint sensor of mobile phone based on Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform. It contains four parts.
</br>Sever: Receiving file access request from the PC client and sending it to user's Android APP. Authorizing or denying the request according to the behavior of user's Android APP. Plus, we used a combination of symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption and Secure Hash algorithm for secure communication.
</br>Android Client: Authoring the access to encrypted files of PCs.
</br>PC Client: Adding or removing encrypted files. Sending requests to Sever when other users want to access those files.
</br>Driver: Controlling access to encrypted files on PC.
